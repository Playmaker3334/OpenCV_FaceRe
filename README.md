## Overview

This project is a Python-based application that utilizes OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier to detect human faces in real-time through a webcam. It's simple, efficient, and can be used as a foundation for more complex face recognition projects.

## Features

- Real-time detection of faces using a webcam.
- Dynamic labeling with incrementing identifiers for each detected face.
- Adjustable detection settings for different use-cases and environments.

## Setup

Before running the application, make sure you have Python and the OpenCV library installed on your system.

- Python can be downloaded from the official site: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- OpenCV can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless
